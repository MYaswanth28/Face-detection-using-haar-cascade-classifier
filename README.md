# Face detection using haar cascade classifier
Face detection using haar cascade classifier with OpenCV and count the faces present in the given  image


# Description:
- This repository contains a Python script that uses the Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV to detect faces in an input image.
- The script reads an image from the provided file path, converts it to grayscale, and then applies the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces.
- Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the total count of faces is displayed on the image.

# Features:
- Face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV.
- Accurate and fast detection of faces in images.
- Bounding boxes are drawn around detected faces for visualization.
- Display of the total count of faces in the image.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) Library

# Instructions:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Ensure you have Python and the OpenCV library installed on your system.
- Place the input image you want to test in the repository's Photos folder (or provide the correct file path in the script).
- Run the script using a Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook
- Copy code
- The script will display the input image with bounding boxes around detected faces and the total count of faces.

# Example Usage:
For Example Usage use Face Count in image.ipynb file which contains Python code
